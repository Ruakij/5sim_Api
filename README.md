# 5sim.net Api Library
This is a library to use the official 5sim Api.
## Installation
Import the .dll into your project.

## Usage
Create a new `_5sim.Api`.
Within the constructor-method you pass your api-token from 5sim.

## How to use it
I am mostly following the official Api from 5sim,
therefore you should have a look at their Api: https://5sim.net/docs/api_en.txt?68dc38df57 (24.02.2020)
